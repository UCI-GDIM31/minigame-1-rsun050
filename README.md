## Devlog
<b>PROMPT: Write a metaphor for how you would describe the relationship between Components, GameObjects, and Scenes to another student. In the first in-class activity, we described Components as being the “building blocks” of GameObjects, and GameObjects as the “building blocks” of Scenes; come up with your own creative way to visualize and describe this relationship without using the phrase “building blocks”.</b>

Scenes are made up of GameObjects. GameObjects can be anything really, from level objects like the ground or platforms, to players and enemies, and also game items. How GameObjects behave is defined by the Components they have (eg: code, collision with other GameObjects, size, appearance, etc).
